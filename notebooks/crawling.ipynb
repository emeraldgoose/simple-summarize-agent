       "<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Feature Generation Disparity</strong>: This often arises when the offline feature pipeline does not mimic the online environment, leading to discrepancies in real-time predictions.</li>\n",

       "<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Feature disparity investigation</h2>\n",
       "<p>There are two potential root causes for such online and offline feature disparities: </p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Feature staleness vs cached residuals</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Feature Staleness</strong> occurs when most recent feature values are not available during serving. It is primarily due to at<strong> </strong>least -1d or -2d delays in the feature pipeline, with minor delays from feature uploads occurring a few hours after the data is ready.</p>\n",
       "<p><strong>Cached Residuals</strong> occur when feature values are null or no longer available after the most recent pipeline run. Since the Online Feature Store only overrides existing keys or adds new ones without evicting the old entries, outdated data can persist.</p>\n",
       "<p>To gain further insights, we conduct a deep dive for newly added topmost important features to better understand the feature serving dynamics.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenges</h3>\n",
       "<p>Both of these cases<strong> </strong>are difficult to address perfectly using offline feature joining logic. Since:</p>\n",
       "<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>For <strong>Feature Staleness</strong>, the SLA varies across features due to the variances in the pipeline implementations, processed data volume, availability of computation resources, feature uploading velocities, etc.</li>\n",
       "<li>For <strong>Cached Residuals</strong>, since it’s unknown how many existing feature values in the Online Feature Store are absolute values, thus hard to tell which entity suffers from this case mostly. </li></ul>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key insights</h3>\n",
       "<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Feature staleness</strong> - <em>The current -1d offsite for offline feature join is a very aggressive choice. </em>Analysis of online logging shows that most feature values used for a given prediction were from the consumer’s engagement 2-3d<strong> </strong>earlier, indicating a long SLA from data generation to feature availability.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Cached residuals</strong> - We assume that any feature values older than 4 days are likely due to long-lived historical values remaining in the Feature Store. This results in a lower missing rate during online serving and is a key factor contributing to feature disparity.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Ubiquity:</strong> Both Feature Staleness and Cached Residuals impact most features, though the severity of these issues varies depending on the feature.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>AUC Gaps:</strong> By generating simulated data with longer feature active_date offsites (from 1d to 3d/4d), we observed a reduced AUC gap, validating the impact of these issues.</li></ul>\n",
       "<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cached residuals</h4>\n",
       "<p>Features most impacted by Cached Residuals are likely to have these characteristics:</p>\n",

       "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why was the online vs offline gap not as significant before 2023?</h3>\n",
       "<p><strong>Scale of the Business</strong>: The ads business has grown 3-5x over the past year, leading to increased data volume and feature complexity, which has amplified the impact of feature staleness and cached residuals.</p>\n",
       "<p><strong>Model Architecture</strong>: Previously, tree-based models were less sensitive to feature disparities because they bucketize values into leaf nodes, meaning small differences often have minimal impact. However, DNNs, being parametric models, are much more sensitive to precise feature values, where even slight deviations can affect the model's output. This shift to DNNs has made the online vs. offline gap more significant. </p>\n",

      "<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Feature Generation Disparity</strong>: This often arises when the offline feature pipeline does not mimic the online environment, leading to discrepancies in real-time predictions.</li>\n",
      "<li><strong>Data Distribution Shift (Concept Drift)</strong>: Changes in the underlying data distribution over time, such as seasonal changes in consumer behavior, could significantly impact model generalization. </li>\n",
      "<li><strong>Model Serving Instability</strong>: Issues with the model serving infrastructure, such as latency or incorrect model versions, might be affecting online performance.</li></ol>\n",
      "<p>For each hypothesis, we conduct experiments, analyze the data, identify root causes, apply fixes, and redeploy the model. This iterative process continues until all performance gaps are resolved or new issues emerge.</p>\n",
      "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Design of experiment - offline replay</strong></h3>\n",

      "<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Feature disparity investigation</h2>\n",
      "<p>There are two potential root causes for such online and offline feature disparities: </p>\n",
      "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Feature staleness vs cached residuals</h3>\n",
      "<p><strong>Feature Staleness</strong> occurs when most recent feature values are not available during serving. It is primarily due to at<strong> </strong>least -1d or -2d delays in the feature pipeline, with minor delays from feature uploads occurring a few hours after the data is ready.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cached Residuals</strong> occur when feature values are null or no longer available after the most recent pipeline run. Since the Online Feature Store only overrides existing keys or adds new ones without evicting the old entries, outdated data can persist.</p>\n",
      "<p>To gain further insights, we conduct a deep dive for newly added topmost important features to better understand the feature serving dynamics.</p>\n",
      "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenges</h3>\n",
      "<p>Both of these cases<strong> </strong>are difficult to address perfectly using offline feature joining logic. Since:</p>\n",
      "<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>For <strong>Feature Staleness</strong>, the SLA varies across features due to the variances in the pipeline implementations, processed data volume, availability of computation resources, feature uploading velocities, etc.</li>\n",
      "<li>For <strong>Cached Residuals</strong>, since it’s unknown how many existing feature values in the Online Feature Store are absolute values, thus hard to tell which entity suffers from this case mostly. </li></ul>\n",
      "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key insights</h3>\n",
      "<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Feature staleness</strong> - <em>The current -1d offsite for offline feature join is a very aggressive choice. </em>Analysis of online logging shows that most feature values used for a given prediction were from the consumer’s engagement 2-3d<strong> </strong>earlier, indicating a long SLA from data generation to feature availability.</li>\n",
      "<li><strong>Cached residuals</strong> - We assume that any feature values older than 4 days are likely due to long-lived historical values remaining in the Feature Store. This results in a lower missing rate during online serving and is a key factor contributing to feature disparity.</li>\n",
      "<li><strong>Ubiquity:</strong> Both Feature Staleness and Cached Residuals impact most features, though the severity of these issues varies depending on the feature.</li>\n",
      "<li><strong>AUC Gaps:</strong> By generating simulated data with longer feature active_date offsites (from 1d to 3d/4d), we observed a reduced AUC gap, validating the impact of these issues.</li></ul>\n",
      "<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cached residuals</h4>\n",
      "<p>Features most impacted by Cached Residuals are likely to have these characteristics:</p>\n",

      "<p>This investigation not only resolved immediate performance gaps but also highlighted the importance of feature alignment in real-time systems.

Moving forward, adopting robust logging systems and scaling feature pipelines will ensure that our models continue to drive impactful business outcomes.</p>\n",
      "<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other thoughts</h2>\n",
      "<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why was the online vs offline gap not as significant before 2023?</h3>\n",
      "<p><strong>Scale of the Business</strong>: The ads business has grown 3-5x over the past year, leading to increased data volume and feature complexity, which has amplified the impact of feature staleness and cached residuals.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Model Architecture</strong>: Previously, tree-based models were less sensitive to feature disparities because they bucketize values into leaf nodes, meaning small differences often have minimal impact. However, DNNs, being parametric models, are much more sensitive to precise feature values, where even slight deviations can affect the model's output. This shift to DNNs has made the online vs. offline gap more significant. </p>\n",
